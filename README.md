From my love of lindy hop and using dance videos as a reference for my own learning came ‘Vindy’, a full stack Restful application. It utilises the Youtube API in order to search and collate videos for future reference. It was built using HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, Node.js, ES6, Tokens, AJAX, JSON, Express, Gulp.

The user is presented with their profile page once they log in which I would eventually like to add image upload to. They will be able to see the video collections they've already added and delete them if they wish.

Users can then manage their collections by creating a new one or editing existing ones.

If the user wants to add a new video to a collection, that's where the Youtube API gets involved. Once a search word is entered the top 9 results from youtube are displayed on the page. I could add more but decided to keep it quite contained and clean on the page. The user can then select one, give it a name and description then add it to their collection.

I would love to make this app more sociable and eventually allow friends to share their collections.
